    // bio: `Dennis R. Schaart is head of the section Medical Physics & Technology at the Radiation Science & Technology department of Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).\n\nHe started his career as an R&D physicist at Nucletron (now Elekta), where he developed new devices for radiotherapy. In his private time he wrote a PhD thesis on the subject of intravascular brachytherapy, for which he obtained his doctoral degree (with highest honors) at TU Delft in 2002.\n\nHe subsequently joined the university to set up a new research line on in-vivo molecular imaging technology, with special focus on ultrafast detectors for time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET).\n\nSince 2016, he also coordinates the research activities of TU Delft within the R&D program of the Holland Proton Therapy Centre (HollandPTC), a joint initiative of Erasmus Medical Centre (Erasmus MC), Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), and TU Delft. Dennis has (co-)authored more than 100 journal papers and is a frequently invited speaker.`,
